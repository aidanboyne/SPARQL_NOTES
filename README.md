SPARQL
===

#### Helpful Resources
- _Learning Sparql, 2nd Edition_ by Bob DuCharme: [Download](https://oiipdf.com/learning-sparql-2nd-edition)
  - Very thorough introduction to the language. Would reccommend reading and referring back to but don't get too caught up in the examples.
- [_SPARQL Working Group_](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-overview-20130321/): Documentation of SPARQL by its creators
- Learning Repo on GraphDB
  - I've created a small repository with toy data corresponding to the examples that you can use. Files used to create the repo are under the **Learning_Repo** folder in this github repository.

SPARQL is the query language for RDF, a directed and labeled graph format for representing data. Data is primarily represented in **triples** consisting of a subject, predicate and object. 

Each subject and predicate must be **URIs** (Universal Resource Identifiers)
